Simulation of String Art
When I was a teanager, I use to like to make string art projects.

For example I made an owl that is similar to this picture:

![Owl](images/owl.jpg.jpg?raw=true "Title")

To make eyes of the owl, you would use one color of thread and then string the thread to say every 10th tack. Then you would switch coloes and then string the thread to say every 20th tack. The size of the circle you formed depended how many tacks you skipped when you strung the thread.

This program simulates creating the owl eyes using a simple java program.

![Program](images/simulation.jpg?raw=true "Title")
